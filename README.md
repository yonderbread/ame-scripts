# Windows 10 AME

## (Bits n' Pieces)

These are Powershell batch scripts taken from the [Windows 10 AME scripts](https://git.ameliorated.info/malte/scripts). I was wanting to use some parts of the script to remove telemetry and bloat from my Windows 10 installation, but didn't want to run the entirety of the script because there were a few bits I needed/wanted to keep. My solution was just to cut all the parts out for each section and make separate scripts, and viola!
